    "What does Dark Ace mean to you?": "Through my work on the Roots of Flight disc golf history podcast, I have been learning more and more details about the countercultural beginnings of the sport that have continued on through the corporatization and mainstreamifying disc golf has seen over the last 2-3 decades. I got into disc golf in part due to its niche feel and the community I found but seeing disc golf push more into the mainstream I have felt some of that feel and community start to erode in favor of more eyes on and more corporate money in the sport. I don't begrudge people their more mainstream experience, but like my rural hometown it has started to feel like the stereotypical \"jock\" vibe has been growing and I know disc golf is huge in church communities that typically frown on the metal scene and the people in it. \n\nFor me, Dark Ace is a community of people that love what I love: metal. In a disc golf landscape that is increasingly commodified and bland, DA gives metal fans a banner to gather around and share in the good times we all know from moshing and headbanging at local and touring shows, living life a little (or a lot) off-kilter, and accepting everyone who loves hard music and isn't a jerk. Finding out this community exists in disc golf and seeing like-minded people gather around the brand to listen to metal and play disc golf has shown me the counterculture streak runs deep and I'll always be able to find it and share rounds and tunes with people like me.",

I have 150+ tag members and 500+ in our FB group. We host 8-10 events a year, and leagues 2+ days a week. Would love to partner up with the club and myself to help promote it more.\n\nI met you guys at Ledgestone this year, we all had those dope ass jerseys with the beer drinking robot on them. When I first got there, I was just wandering around taking it all in, but as I was walking around, I heard brutal blast beats in the background and was like, what the fuck is going on over there?... and just beelined towards the music and it brought me to Dark Ace. You were all very cool and down to earth. Loved it. \n \nIf I can leave you with one of my favorites lines from a metal song, it would likely be from Machine Head \"Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast!\" \n\nThanks - Doostain",

A \"We are going to do it the way we want\" theme all while giving back to those less fortunate than ourselves. Disc golf means family, and more specifically the Dark Ace brand represents the empathy & selflessness that I want to see all brands and disc golf clubs adopt. Donating meals to those in need all well spreading good music, clothing, and metal vibes along the way is what initially drew me to dark ace. I would love nothing more than to have the privilege of representing the   brand in my local scene and beyond. The sky is the limit, and it's been so exciting to watch the brand grow. \n\nThanks for the opportunity, your hard work does not go unnoticed! Play disc golf & listen to metal!",

All I knew is the more I listened the more I enjoyed the face melting sounds I heard. I‚Äôve played disc golf for about 3 years now and when I found y‚Äôall‚Äôs brand I was hoping for this day to come. Y‚Äôall represent growth in the sport and being a complete badass at the same time! Just like the many subcategories in metal, the Dark Ace brand is embraced and represented by people and all walks of life. Thank you for this opportunity and rock on!!!",

    "What does Dark Ace mean to you?": "Dark Ace is more than just a brand. It‚Äôs a whole community. It‚Äôs using the sport to grow the community or using the community to grow the sport. It‚Äôs not just playing or competing but using what you have for good. Disc golfers and Metal heads can often have a bad reputation. Disc golfers can often be mistaken for hippies or pot heads. Metal heads can often be mistaken for hard, scary, beer drinking bikers. But neither are really true. We have big hearts, we come together when one of us is down. Maybe you had you bag stolen we ban together offer up discs or fundraisers to get you started back up. Maybe you had a house fire we fundraise and hold tournaments to help you out. We do Ice bowls for charity. Dark Ace is exactly that. My first order I received a note stating that Dark Ace puts money towards providing meals for those in need. It was at that moment I knew this was the company I wanted to give my business, money and time to. It‚Äôs an incredible thing and I would be honoured to be apart of that. An example of how I do that with my community is my fianc√© and I in 2020 held a pop up course for my friend who was raising money for her kidney walk. She had a kidney transplant a year prior and couldn‚Äôt actually do the walk. Instead she played disc golf and we held a donate to participate event that raised over $1000 for her. My fianc√© is a huge metal head as well. We both have huge hearts. Our best friend who introduced us to Disc Golf took his life this year. He too was big into metal and his last concert was Slipknot. Our last disc golf round together we talked about Slipknot and how it was his first ever metal concert. We miss him dearly. Arlen Nickel and I held a tournament this year called the Prairie Playoff. We did a fundraising event we called the Tilt-a-whirl. All money was put into a pot 50% went to the first person who landed an Ace and 50% would go to mental health. No one landed an ace and all participants agreed to have all the funds be donated to mental health. I guess what I am trying to say is Dark Ace has values that I admire, respect and would love to represent as I have those same values. Aside from that I think it would be totally badass promoting Dark Ace through out Canada as I don‚Äôt think many know what it‚Äôs all about BUT everyone LOVES my jacket and shirts when I wear them on the course. I think we could make amazing things happen together.",

Even if nobody‚Äôs got me, I know the music does and will carry me through. The synergy between disc golf and metal is surreal. It hypes me up on my way to a tournament that‚Äôs 3 hours away, and I was too fucking cheap to buy a hotel the night before. It also brings me back to life when I left it all on the course and it wasn‚Äôt enough. Metal keeps me balanced and moving forward.\nDark Ace is the combination of the two and I would love nothing less than to rock this company every day and in every tournament round I play. \n\n\nCaveat: I also have a full 5 minute video explaining why I love disc golf and Metal if you guys wanted that at all.

    "What does Dark Ace mean to you?": "At first glance I am that stereotypical metal head: big, bearded and tattooed. What you don‚Äôt see is that I am a family man with a big heart who loves disc golf. My best friend introduced me to the sport in 2019 and I have been hooked ever since. My fianc√© , 2 kids and I kind of made a name for ourselves in Saskatchewan. We traveled around our province playing every single course that existed. At the time it was 65 courses. We are now up to approx. 85. This year we traveled across Canada from BC to Ontario. In our 3 short years of play, Udisc says I have played over 190 courses. That‚Äôs how hardcore we are. We fell in love with this sport and this community and we went all out. Last year I started participating in tournaments‚Ä¶.. am I good? Well my fianc√© says I am. I feel like I am always stuck in the middle in my division and I am happy to just be out there playing and meeting all the people in this amazing community of ours. In 2 years of tournament play I have participated in 16 sanctioned events and at least 20 unsanctioned. I Directed my first tournament this summer and have committed 2 other events and helped/volunteered in many other disc golf events. I have provided clinics, course designs and opening courses and set up tournaments. I am a huge supporter of the smaller communities where my fianc√© and I travel to provide them glow events and leagues. Anyone can disc golf but if we want to grow our sport we have to put in time and effort to keep this sport alive. Disc golf is not just a hobby it‚Äôs a lifestyle, just like heavy metal. There is nothing out there like banging chakns and head banging. I say all this because like my disc golf play in my 38 years of life I have been to at least 60 metal shows which is pretty huge for the area I live in. We don‚Äôt have a huge gathering of metal shows so when one comes my way I am quick to jump on it. This year I was lucky enough to attend a bucket list concert, Slipknot. That concert means the absolute most to me because it was the last concert my best friend went to before he took his own life. He meant a lot to me because he introduced this sport to me, a sport that changed my life saved my life. My last round with him we chatted about how amazing the concert was and how it was his first ever metal concert. So listening to metal and playing disc golf is not just a motto, it‚Äôs a way of life. It brings me the most happiness. Like I said I may not be the best disc golfer, but I am one of the most enthusiastic and one who really breaks all the stereotypes of what a metal head can be and what a disc golfer can look like. What Dark Ace stands for is what I stand for when you have something amazing you don‚Äôt hide it, you share it and you celebrate it. This is what I would love to do for Dark Ace if given the opportunity.",

Let's grow together!\n\nUnfortunately the weather is so bad where we're at for the next few weeks i can't totally get out to put a true sponsor tape, but my tiktok and instagram are a pretty good representation of those things in tandem with my other sponsors.

This same welcoming environment is what I love about the St. Louis disc golf community and I feel that George has captured that with Dark Ace and has since passed it on into other communities through the brand.  While I don't listen to much metal, the aesthetic that Dark Ace has established compliments my style very well. That backed with the incredible community is what Dark Ace means to me.",

I've ran into people at tournaments who have been sporting the gear as well, and we immediately launched into our favorite bands, what festivals/concerts we were planning to hit up and hitting each other up when we were all going to be at a show together. The ties that hold this community together are stronger than any other I've been a part of. The music aspect is, unbelievably, even bigger for me. I've loved metal for a majority of my life. Starting with the punk bands of my teenage years to the metal I love now, this music has played such an instrumental part of my life. The entire vibe of Dark Ace just sums up my persona perfectly. Dark Ace is what I've been searching for since I started playing. When I met George at Amateur Worlds this past summer, I immediately knew this was a thing I wanted to be a part of, because it is everything I want to align myself with.",

    "What does Dark Ace mean to you?": "Dark ace to me, is bringing a whole new meaning to disc golf. For me, it's meshing my outside world of metal, within my world of disc golf. Dark ace is its own family, where on the outside we may look intimidating but are full of nothing but support, smiles & love. Being able to be on the team to be apart of the family would mean the world to me & I'd have that side of disc golf that understood my weirdness of metal & tutus ^_^",

    "What does Dark Ace mean to you?": "It's about being myself really. Everyone who knows me, knows my love of heavy music and disc golf. I enjoy the skateboard esq vibe the brand has, going against the grain of traditional disc golf apparel which truly fits my personality. \nI've been rocking the brand since I discovered the dark ace IG page back in 2020 and have made multiple posts sporting my dark ace gear, and have been in the back of some jomez and gate keeper videos sporting the gear as well. \n\nIt would mean alot to me to have dark ace back me in the 2023 season where I will be back to playing tournaments consistantly. 2022 was a wash for me needing to take a break after having my first kid, but it has made me hungry. \n\nI want to apologize for the late submission. I wanted to be the guy with the midnight dead line submission but didn't take into account all the troubles I would run into uploading everything. My official sponsor video is on my page yall are tagged in because it is over the 100MB limit so I just uploaded a couple of dual basket putts.\n\nHope to hear back from yall soon!\nThank you!\n-thediscgolfmann",

I am currently sponsored by a local company called Inside the Circle. I was chosen to be part of this team for community leadership, and the way I represent myself as well as the sport of disc golf. My 2023 goals include playing at least 2 A-Tiers, putting in C1 to be 90% or better, and reach a consistent 880 rating. Dark ace apparel would help me stay comfortable in my game, as well as feeling good and doing good.",
